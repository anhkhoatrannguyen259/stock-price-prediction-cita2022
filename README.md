# Stock Price Prediction Using Time Series Models with BigDL
Stock market prediction is one of the important and challenging issues. This is an interesting problem that has attracted the attention of researchers and investors from the past to the present. In this study, we will build time series models based on the BigDL platform to serve the problem of stock price prediction, we approach it with three methods: AutoTS Pipeline (with TCN, LSTM, Seq2Seq models), Standalone Forecaster Pipeline (with LSTM, TCN, Prophet, Seq2Seq, NBeats models) and self-built models (GRU, LSTM). The methods are tested, compared and evaluated on the stock price dataset of the Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (Vietcombank) that we collected ourselves, this is a stock with a large trading day series and we will use the models to predict daily closing prices. The results obtained show that the AutoTS Pipeline approach with the LSTM model gives the best results with RMSE = 2.30, MAPE = 1.35. In the future, we will further study how to improve the performance of the models, approach new methods to solve this problem, and expand the work to solve other related problems.
